# aequus

A recursive recipe calculator inspired by chemistry

## What is this for?

Aequus helps you calculate the total quantities of raw materials for recipes. The recipes can be simple or have dozens of ingredients. For ingredients that are themselves creatable, it can recurse through them until you arrive at a complete calculation of every raw material needed to create something.

"Aequus" is a Latin word that can mean "equal" or "like." This application draws inspiration from chemical equations because balancing chemical equations and complex recipes share many concepts.

You can use this program for cooking recipes in real life, crafting recipes in simulations or video games (like Minecraft), or anywhere recipes appear. It is designed in an abstract way to allow the definition of recipes of many kinds.

## Features

- Recursive calculation of raw materials
- Support for probabilistic ingredients (things create through a chance-based process)
- Define jobs to produce n quantity of an item and calculate the raw materials needed for the job
- Define multiple recipes per product
